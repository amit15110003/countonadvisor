		<p class="th-textcont">With medical costs spiraling out of control and the increase in shift to lifestyle diseases, healthcare today is at its all-time high in terms of treatment costs. In the event of an unforeseen illness, you may have no option other than to utilize your hard earned savings, built over your lifetime. Finally, what’s more important than your health and what better way to protect it than with the right Health Insurance Plan.<br><br>


		A Health Insurance plan ensures complete peace of mind and makes sure that you use your hard-earned savings for the real reasons – Be it your child’s higher education or his dream wedding, a well deserved family vacation or just about anything you dreamt of all your life.<br><br>


		For those who have a family, we recommend a family floater instead of a standalone policy since the probability of all family members needing hospitalisation at one go is remote.<br><br>


		Even if your employer offers group medical insurance, get your own cover. A change of job or retirement could leave you without health insurance. Getting a fresh cover after 45 is anyways difficult.<br><br></p>
